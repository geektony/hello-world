# hello-world
Creating the Hello world to familiarize myself and as an initial step towards joining the Chef style Kungfu!
I am a member of a new group at Optum who will roll out the first Dev-Ops stlye product called MyID.  This is the kind of thing I have always wanted to be able to do!  Hopefully nobody wakes me up, because I am living the dream.
